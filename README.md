# memberApp
Spring boot app for basic CRUD operations on members/memberships

To start application we need to have mysql started on port 3306 with user "root" and password "root". Then we need to have database "members_app_db" created. 
These data are not explicit and can be changed in application.properties file.
<br><br>Database tables and data will be populated using schema.sql and data.sql located in resource folder. 
After the initial start of the application, schema.sql and data.sql files should be deleted.
<br><br>Now we can perform operations on members and memberships.
